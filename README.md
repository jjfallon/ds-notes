# Data Science Notes

This repository contains jupyter notebooks where I explore various data science tools and techniques. Notebooks can be roughly split into two: those that detail how to use a particular tool or library; and those that explore concepts (though there is plenty of overlap).

## Concepts
1. **trees-to-tree.ipynb**: fitting a single decision tree to reproduce the results of a boosted decision tree (to improve interpreitability).
2. **imbalanced.ipynb**: methods to correct for class imbalance.

## Tool usage
1. **doc2vec_basics.ipynb**: using doc2vec from gensim to create vectors for whole documents based on word embeddings.
2. **text-classify.ipynb**: boiler plate code for performing text classification.
